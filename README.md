# Ether JS helpers

Welcome to the **Ether JS helpers** repository! This project contains a collection of utilities and helpers designed to simplify blockchain development, particularly in the **Ethereum ecosystem**. These tools are meant to address common tasks in blockchain programming, such as signature verification, working with bytecode, and interacting with transactions.

## Features

- **Reusable Helpers:** Each helper is designed to handle a specific task so you can plug it into your workflow with minimal effort.
- **Modular Design:** Easy to integrate with existing Ethereum and blockchain projects.
- **Expandable:** Built with the expectation of adding more utilities over time, ensuring the project evolves with new feature requirements.

## Current Helpers

The repository currently includes the following tools:

1. **`verifySignature.js`:**  
   A utility for verifying the legitimacy of a transaction signature using the Ethereum library. Recover signer addresses and validate blockchain activity securely and effectively.

2. **`splitBytecode.js`:**  
   A helper to split and parse Ethereum contract bytecode into neatly formatted lines. This is useful for debugging and inspecting smart contracts.

3. **`getTransactionData.js`:**  
   A utility to fetch detailed blockchain transaction data from Ethereum or compatible networks like Polygon, Optimism, and more.

## Usage

Each helper in this repository is standalone and can be imported into your project. Below is an example of how to use one of the utilities (**`verifySignature.js`**):

```javascript
// Import the helper function into your project
const { verifySignature } = require('./verifySignature');

// Call the helper function with the required parameters
verifySignature(rawHash, signature);
```

Make sure to refer to the individual script files for usage details and code samples. The helpers leverage popular blockchain libraries, including `ethers.js`, for seamless interaction with Ethereum networks.

## Prerequisites

Before using any of the helpers, ensure you have the following dependencies installed in your project:

- **Node.js** with npm (or your choice of Node.js package manager)
- **Ethers.js** for blockchain-related operations

Install the required packages using npm:

```bash
npm install ethers
npm install @ethersproject/bytes @ethersproject/rlp
```

For helpers that interact with specific testnets or mainnets, you will also need an RPC provider (e.g., [Infura](https://infura.io/)).

## Future Plans

This repository is designed to grow with time. The aim is to include more **Ethereum-based helpers** and **generalized blockchain utilities**. Possible future additions might cover tasks such as:

- Advanced transaction debugging.
- Contract deployment tools.
- Token standard interaction helpers (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155).
- On-chain event monitoring utilities.

Feedback and feature requests are welcome!
